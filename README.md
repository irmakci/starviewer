# Starviewer

Starviewer is a cross-platform medical imaging software dedicated to DICOM images produced by medical equipment (MRI, CT, PET, PET-CT, CR, MG,...) fully compliant with the DICOM standard for image communication and image file formats. It can also read many other file formats specified by the MetaIO standard (*.mhd files). 

Starviewer is able to receive images transferred by DICOM communication protocol from any PACS or medical imaging modality (STORE SCP - Service Class Provider, STORE SCU - Service Class User, and Query/Retrieve). Starviewer enables navigation and visualization of multimodality and multidimensional images through a complete 2D Viewer which integrates advanced reconstruction techniques such as Thick Slab (including Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP), Minimum Intensity Projection (MinIP) and average projection), fast orthogonal reconstruction, 3D navigation tools such as 3D-Cursor, and basic support for PET-CT image fusion. It also incorporates Multi-Planar Reconstruction (MPR) and 3D Viewer for volume rendering.
